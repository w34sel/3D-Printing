# 🛠️ 3D Printing Mods for Elegoo Neptune 4 Plus

Welcome to my personal collection of mods, upgrades, and tools for the **Elegoo Neptune 4 Plus**. This includes profiles, firmware updates, cable management, and more.

---

## 📦 How to Use

### 🧠 Cura 5.6

Copy the `definition` folder to:
C:\Program Files\UltiMaker Cura 5.6.0\share\cura\resources\

### 🐳 Orca Slicer 2.1.1

Copy the `Elegoo` folder and `Elegoo.json` to:
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\OrcaSlicer\system  
**or**  
download just the install.bat file and run it.

### 🐳 Orca Slicer 2.2.0+

⚠️ Notice: OrcaSlicer 2.2.0+ Profiles Not Persisting
After encountering several failed prints, I discovered that something was wrong with the custom profiles in OrcaSlicer 2.3.0. Upon investigation, I found that the application automatically overwrites the system profile files with default versions every time it starts.

As a result, custom modifications made to profiles located in the system folder are not preserved, making it currently unsuitable for persistent custom profile setups in that location.

⚠️ <span style="color:red">**OrcaSlicer version 2.2.0 and later is not supported yet!!! The application overwrites the files with the default versions each time it starts.**</span>

> 💡 Use **WebGUI Speed** to increase speed for _Single Speed_ mode.

### 🎛️ PLA Profile – Jayo

Copy the `filament` folder to:
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\OrcaSlicer\user\default
